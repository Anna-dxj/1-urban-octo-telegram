# Urban Octo Telegram

## Description

This webpage has been changed to improve the HTML to follow accessibility standards as well as to better organize the CSS to be more consolidated. By changing both the HTML and the CSS, this website now has a clearer structure, which improves its SEO ranking and allows for any future developers to more easily improve upon the website. The new HTML structure and consolidated CSS also improves load times. The CSS is properly commented to help identify what each selector affects. Lastly, any broken links were fixed. The integrety of the codebase has been maintained.

By finshing this project, I understood the importance of semantic HTML in regards to both SEO ranking and accessibility. I also was able to get more familiar with CSS selectors to make a CSS stylesheet specific and concise.

## Credits

I have consulted a few classmates on this project: 

[Ben Shunwei Hu](https://github.com/diff30140556) helped with markup hyperlink syntax and linking images.

Michael Lin assisted in CSS notes and identifying which selectors corresepond to which HTML lines. 

I consulted Tyler Goodsley, to confirm that I was on the proper path of thinking in regards to making the HTML more accessible.
